# Enhanced LLM Chatbot Questionnaire

This project implements an enhanced LLM chatbot for replacing traditional forms, especially research questionnaires. It provides a dynamic, conversational interface for collecting user responses and stores them in an Airtable database. Upon completion, users can download their responses as a PDF.

## Features

- Dynamic question generation based on previous answers
- Support for various input types (1-7 scale, 0-2 scale, text, etc.)
- Answer validation
- Progress tracking
- Review and edit previous answers
- PDF generation of completed questionnaire

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main page of the web application
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the web application
- `script.js`: Frontend JavaScript logic
- `server.js`: Backend server (placeholder)

## TODO

1. Implement backend server using Express.js
2. Integrate with an LLM service (e.g., OpenAI API) for dynamic question generation
3. Set up Airtable connection for storing user responses
4. Implement PDF generation service
5. Enhance frontend with more robust error handling and user feedback
6. Implement user authentication (if required)
7. Add data privacy and security measures
8. Create an analytics dashboard for researchers
